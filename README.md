	A Programmable approach to building an MPLS network and monitor through Model Driven Telemetry
		By Ashish Panda & Nagendra Kumar (Cisco systems)	

This session takes a complete non CLI driven approach using data models like Yang to build an MPLS network, Build the complete Open source Telemetry Stack and monitor the network through MDT. 

Following are some of the details.
- Introduce the Data models, Yang, NETCONF, gRPC and basic programmability tools (python, ncc, YDK). 
- Using Yang Data Models Build up an MPLS/SR network. 
- Demonstrate use of Yang models (python Sripts/YDK) to monitor/influence various protocols like BGP, IGP , MPLS. 
- Build a complete Open Source Telemetry Collection Stack using open source tools like Pipeline, kafka, Influxdb, Grafana. 
- Configure the routers to stream the telemetry data to the server. 
- Use Model Driven Telemetry to Monitor and influence the Network (IGP/BGP/MPLS).
